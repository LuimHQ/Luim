# Luim: A collaborative knowledge management app

Luim is a collaborative knowledge management app. You can start by choosing a folder as your personal space. All files stay locally until you choose to share it to a space. You can connect other public spaces to your personal space. 

Let's say you're navigating the vast field of Quantum Physics. Your personal space is your canvas, but what if you could effortlessly link up with other knowledge enthusiasts exploring the same domain? By connecting their public spaces to yours, you gain the ability to peek into their insights, draw inspiration, and enrich your own learning journey.
